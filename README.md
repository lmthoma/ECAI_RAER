# Reasoning based on Abstract Equality Relations in LLMs

This repo contains our code and the reported results for our article "Large Language Models Can Reason Based on Abstract Equality Relations".

The Jupyter notebooks for the experiments were developed on the Google Research platform Colaboratory (Google Colab), the data analysis notebok can be run locally. We removed our API keys for the OpenAI platform and the Huggingface API.
